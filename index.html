                    <p>The project supports local primary schools in rural Zimbabwe. All our day scholars receive a lunch funded by you, this is most of the time, the only meal they receive in a day. Providing lunch helps our students engage and focus on a much-needed education to give a chance to access employment and break the poverty cycle. Our project not only funds the local school meals but also provides access to education for all.</p>

                    <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
                    <p>The old shelter was a 20 X 20 shed and no longer maintainable. A new larger facility was built in 2012 and the animals moved to the new shelter in March of 2013, even though the interior and exterior are not fully completed. In July, 2014, the City of Newberg eliminated their Animal Control Program. As of October 2018, NASF purchased the shelter and property from the City of Newberg. This allows us to continue our no-kill animal shelter for the care of homeless animals.</p>

                    <p>Our work is exploding and we need to move our current premises. A farm will enable us to such as a farm will provide the venue, space, office and training space we require to continue our services to the children of Limpopo Province. Purchasing a farm is sound financial investment rather than ongoing renting. Through purchasing a farm we will also be able to generate a steady income for the organization and that means greater sustainability long term and more able to cope with donor delays.</p>
